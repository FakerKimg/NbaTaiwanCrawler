# NbaTaiwanCrawler

need packages : beautifulsoup & requests

First,

localhost:8000/blank/

I run the Django server and enable rest API.
Then I could could crawl the data and send it to server via rest API.

I show the titles at localhost:8000/blank/
click the title would change the page into detailed news.
